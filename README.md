# Setiment Analysis SageMaker Deployment 

In this project I have created a simple web app which interacts with a deployed recurrent neural network performing sentiment analysis on movie reviews. 

For doing this project i was asked to be familiar with SageMaker, the mini-project, Sentiment Analysis using XGBoost, should provide enough background.

Please see the [README](https://github.com/udacity/sagemaker-deployment/tree/master/README.md) in the root directory for instructions on setting up a SageMaker notebook and downloading the project files (as well as the other notebooks).
