# Setiment Analysis SageMaker Deployment 

This is one of [Deep learning nanodegree](https://classroom.udacity.com/nanodegrees/nd101/parts/2e8d3b5d-aa70-4376-946f-0cdc37127d7d/modules/49d2e25d-6df2-48df-8ccd-88417ae208fc/lessons/368c9af3-c8b8-4b01-92ba-40d7e989d6e7/concepts/900d740a-e47d-4b67-be4c-ca27ea8981e2) major projects. In this project I have created a simple web app which interacts with a deployed recurrent neural network performing sentiment analysis on movie reviews. 

For doing this project i was asked to be familiar with SageMaker, the mini-project, Sentiment Analysis using XGBoost, should provide enough background.

Please see the [README](https://github.com/udacity/sagemaker-deployment/tree/master/README.md) in the root directory for instructions on setting up a SageMaker notebook and downloading the project files (as well as the other notebooks).
